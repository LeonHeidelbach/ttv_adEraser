**Tested with uBlock origin and bttv installed**

**TTV AdEraser** aims to remove **livestream ads** as well as **add some useful features** to our favourite streaming site :-).

I will try to maintain this project as well as possible and if you have any feature requests or would like to report bugs, feel free to let me know open up an issue.

At the moment the **extension** and all its features **have only been tested and validated** on [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/). Support for **other browsers** might be added in the future if requested.

## Google Chrome

TTV adEraser is not yet published on the Chrome Web Store but will be added shortly. This means that the extension has to be installed manually for the time being. To do so follow these instructions:

1. Download the ZIP file containing all resources for the extension from the folllowing URL: https://github.com/LeonHeidelbach/ttv_adEraser/archive/main.zip
2. Unzip the file contents into a new folder.
3. Open **Google Chrome**, type `chrome://extensions` into the URL bar and navigate to the installed extensions overview page
4. In the top right corner of the installed extensions overview page, enable **"Developer mode"**.
5. Then click **"Load unpacked"** in the top left corner.
6. A file dialog prompt will open up. Navigate to the folder where you extracted the extension's resource files and select it.

The extension should now be installed and show up in the installed extensions overview! Now you can enjoy an ad free live stream experience.

**IMPORTANT**

 **Do not delete the extension folder** or it will be removed from **Google Chrome**.

## Firefox

Firefox support has not been validated. Some features might not work if you install the extension manually.

## Additional information

- If you previously used a third party script through the `userResourcesLocation` setting in uBlock origin, make sure remove the script and purge the cache, as it might conflict with the extension.
- If you have "Alternate Player for Twitch.tv" installed make sure to disable it.
